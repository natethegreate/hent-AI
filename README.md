# Detecting censors with deep learning and computer vision

Illustrated adult content created in Japan is required to be censored by law. Two common types of censoring involves censor bars and mosaic blurs. For us degenerates living outside of Japan, this means we are also subject to the bars and mosaics. There is a solution, [DeepCreamPy](https://github.com/liaoxiong3x/DeepCreamPy) by deeppomf that can draw over the censors, given that you tell it where the censors are. That is a long and painstaking process, so I hope to automate that process with this project. This project will utilize deep learning and image segmentation, techniques typically used in autonomous vehicles and computer vision tasks. New for 1.6.3, we added ESRGAN as an alternative to DeepCreamPy, which will also decensor a mosaic image/video after the detection.

This is built atop Matterport's [Mask R-CNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06870), and video decensoring uses [ESRGAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.00219).

For both of those examples, the newest model 161 provides far more accurate masks and detection.

# Getting Started
You will need all the same requirements as matterport's Mask RCNN implementation, nothing more. Note that I am using tensorflow 1.8.0, tensorflow-gpu 1.9.0, torch 0.4.1, and keras 2.2.0. I have not fully tested the stability of newer combinations. I use Anaconda3 for my command line. 

Only windows is supported for the executable. You can pull this code for linux.

# The code

* [main.py](main.py) Contains GUI and all I/O handling and file parsing, along with basic error detection. Instantiates detector class.

* [detector.py](detector.py) Contains my detector class, which is responsible for neural network bringup, starting inference detection, and creating overlay from mask for DCP. No longer needs hentai.py, and can run detections on its own. Also handles ESRGAN functionality.

* [hentai.py](samples/hentai/hentai.py) Interfaces between my detector and the model. Based off of the Balloon.py of the Mask RCNN implementation. Only needed for training.

* [inspect_h_model.ipynb](samples/hentai/inspect_h_model.ipynb) This notebook is identical to the balloon notebook. I modified it to work with this project instead, and it is best used to inspect a model. For detailed logging, use Tensorboard (which should be installed if you have tensorflow)

* [inspect_h_data.ipynb](samples/hentai/inspect_h_data.ipynb)
Same thing as above, except this notebook is used to validate the dataset. Also has cool information showing some of the quirks and features of MaskRcnn

* [test_combined_generator.py](test_combined_generator.py) Script that automates bar censoring and annotation, more explained below. This is meant to be placed in a separate folder, and expects uncensored images in a folder called "decensored_input" and outputs the barred image into "decensored_input_original", and populates a csv with the annotations. You do not need to use this script, unless you want to help in expanding the dataset. In which case, join the discord and contact me.

* [hent_AI_COLAB_1.ipynb](hent_AI_COLAB_1.ipynb) Google Colab notebook with instructions for ESRGAN video decensoring. This will use Google's GPUs on the cloud for free, and should be faster than most, if not all consumer GPUs. But, sessions will get deleted after 30 minutes of idle or 12 hours. I reccommend this option for any sort of video decensoring, it is visually good enough and really fast.

* [green_mask_project_mosaic_resolution.py](green_mask_project_mosaic_resolution.py) Script from GMP that estimates a mosaic's granularity (size of the mosaic boxes) for use in ESRGAN decensoring.

* [hconfig.ini](hconfig.ini) Configuration file that holds directory information.

# The Dataset

The dataset has a mix of some hand-done annotations, and mostly hand-done annotated images using our test_combined_generator. This script takes uncensored images as input, and can create a clone of the image with a mosaic and random bar censors, using NudeNet. This dataset is not provided here. You can contact me on Discord if you are interested.

Dataset annotations have were made with the polygon shape. Bar and Mosaic region attributes are formated as:

```
"region_attributes":{"censor":"bar"}} OR "region_attributes":{"censor":"mosaic"}}
```

[Here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1J0T6sZx8sN0wyo3Ctg88nlFWg414256j) is a (NSFW) sample of my dataset annotations, along with the vgg editor.

# The Model

You will want the latest model for better accuracy.

* Model 161 (deprecated) 

* [Model 226](https://www.dropbox.com/s/08r26ho7yxx1fx8/weights226.zip?dl=0)

* [Model 236](https://www.dropbox.com/s/6liwqgop4kazot2/weights236.zip?dl=0) *Packaged with v1.5

* (Latest) [Model 268](https://www.dropbox.com/s/zvf6vbx3hnm9r31/weights268.zip?dl=0)

Simply delete your current weights.h5 file, and replace with the new one. Please keep the model named as weights.h5

ESRGAN (on the code only) is using Twittman's fatal pixels model for 4x superscaling. It is not on this repo as it is protected by MPL-2.0. Download the model 340000 [here](https://de-next.owncube.com/index.php/s/mDGmi7NgdyyQRXL) from his repo. Place this model in the main directory. 

## Requirements

You will need to download and install DeepCreamPy, which is linked in the intro.

The executable will need [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) if you want sound to carry over on videos. Place ffmpeg.exe in the main directory, or somewhere defined in your PATH or in an environment variable. For linux, clone the repo and follow the provided instructions for getting its requirements. To get ffmpeg on linux or colab, use:

```
!sudo add-apt-repository ppa:jon-severinsson/ffmpeg
!sudo apt-get update
!sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
```

(Source code on Windows) I would reccomend running these on a virtual environment, with Anaconda3.
Python 3.5.2, TensorFlow 1.8, Keras 2.2, tensorflow-gpu 1.9.0, torch 0.4.1 and other common packages listed in `requirements.txt`.

* For now, DCP is required until I can create my own alternative. This project expects to use the DCP directory. You can install the executable or the source code, either should work.

* DCP is ONLY compatible with .png images, and not jpg. Either you use png only or try the provided jpg converter (Force jpg button). You can use online tools like jpg2png. Again, this should be done before anything else.

* DCP is NOT compatible with screentones, or that dotted effect that is characteristic of printed works (see below). Simply refer to my other project, [Screentone Remover](https://github.com/natethegreate/Screentone-Remover), which will batch remove screentones using Digital Signal Processing techniques. This is the only way for printed non-colored images to be decensored.

Here is an example of a screentoned image, and what it looks like when removed by my Screentone Remover app:
![Screentone removal example](assets/screentoneexsfw.jpg)

* For full video decensoring via ESRGAN, you will need to download Twittman's model [here](https://de-next.owncube.com/index.php/s/mDGmi7NgdyyQRXL) and place it inside the ColabESRGAN/models folder. 

* Nvidia GPU owners should install CUDA 9.0, and cuDNN 7.6.4. Note that there are issues with RTX cards and ESRGAN, so if you want to use that I again reccomend the colab notebook instead. 

## Important Notes (READ BEFORE USING)

* I highly reccommend running hent-AI on batches, for example one doujin or a few doujins at once. The slowest part of hent-AI is the initialization, so the first inference takes time but the rest will be quicker. 

* The current model is not perfect. Yet. Expect some trouble with white censor bars, small censor bars, partially-transparent censor bars, and censor bars that are fused together as one large censor. Any absurd amount of censoring may cause issues for hent-AI.

* This model is not trained in recognizing full censorship, where genetalia is not drawn at all. Non-standard censoring is also not supported. 

* The model supports mosaics and bars, but it really struggles when both are used on the same spot. Also, DCP can only generate for bars or mosaics, so you will need to keep mosaic censoring works separate from bar censored works. If you must decensor images with both, I  suggest decensoring the bars on one run, then the mosaics on a seconds run.

* CUDA compatible Nvidia GPUs are reccommended for large amounts of images, or videos. If you don't have one, refer to the [colab notebook](hent_AI_COLAB_1.ipynb).

* The Video Maker button creates a video from the output of DCP in decensored_output. Run this after DCP completes. Note you still need to select the directories for the source video, and the DCP install directory.

* Do not put entire clips through the video detection, it is a very slow task. If you can, edit in only the short clips with visible mosaics, get the decensored output, then edit them in the rest of the video.

* The compiled exe release does not support ESRGAN. If you want to use this, refer to the colab notebook.
